# 🎮 Revenue Metrics Analysis (PostgreSQL + Tableau)

## 📌 Project Description
📉 In September, the number of new paid users dropped sharply — and so did MRR.
📈 But by October, the picture changed: churn decreased, and subscription expansions brought in more revenue than the losses.
To track these shifts, I built a Revenue Metric Dashboard in Tableau.
It helps answer key business questions:
Are we growing thanks to new users, or through upsells to existing ones?
How is ARPPU (Average Revenue per Paid User) evolving over time?
Where do we lose the most — churn or revenue contraction?
This dashboard is not just about numbers. It helps shape strategy: balancing acquisition, retention, and expansion.

## Main stages

1️⃣ Data Collection & Preparation

Collected and organized company revenue data into a structured format.

Used PostgreSQL to clean, aggregate, and calculate key financial indicators (revenue by product, region, and time period).

2️⃣ Data Modeling in Tableau

Connected SQL outputs to Tableau.

Built a data model with relationships between tables, enabling filtering by product category, sales channel, and customer segment.

3️⃣ Dashboard Development

Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize:

📈 Revenue trends over time

📊 Growth dynamics

🏷️ Performance by products and regions

Added KPIs and time-series charts to track financial results effectively.

4️⃣ Documentation & Maintenance

Created detailed documentation covering:

SQL queries

Tableau data model

Dashboard structure

Ensured the project can be easily updated and maintained in the future.
* Finally, I wrote detailed documentation that allows to effectively interact and maintain the dashboard.
